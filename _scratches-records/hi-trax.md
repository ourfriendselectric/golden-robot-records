Hi Trax are a UK/Australian collective mixing up bass driven, violent beats with technical double time flows.

You should know Joe Snow from renowned UK crew Defenders Of Style, (*The Death of Meaning, Upper Echelon*). After touring Australia in 2016 he settled in Melbourne and developed connections with local legends Sinks and Raptorhandz (Able 8). The love of Hip-Hop and the shared passion of unique sound design and the creation of explosive hard sounds has spawned this unique connection.

Hi Trax pays homage to Hip-Hop, Grime and Dubstep - blending these influences to create a unique style of up-tempo, bass-heavy electronica straight to yaâ€™ face\!

NEW EP DUE OUT EARLY 2019 ON SCRATCHES RECORDS.
