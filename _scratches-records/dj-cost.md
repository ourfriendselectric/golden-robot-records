DJ Cost is true school. A dedicated student of Hip Hop culture and the art of Turntablism. With an extensive list of accolades to add to his name, namely his 2016, 2017, and 2018 N.S.W DMC Champion titles; DJ Cost is up there with Australia’s top ranked turntablists.

No stranger the stage, Cost has been P.Smurf’s reliable right hand man since 2011. Not only an integral part of his live shows, but also with his extensive cuts over all of P.Smurf’s solo releases. DJ Cost is also a member of Blue Mountains DUB collective ‘Cooking With Caustic’ and has been the tour DJ for local acts Thundamentals, Ozi Batla, and Dialectrix, plus supported international veterans like Lord Finesse, Large Professor, and R.A the Rugged Man to name a few, all whilst laying down studio cuts for the likes of Tuka, Pegz, Daily Meds, and Thundamentals.

With over 10 years experience, and numerous notches already on his belt, DJ Cost is only set for more growth, both on stage and in the studio.&nbsp;
