Nozomu Wakai, hailed globally as the guitarist to bring forward authentic and melodic heavy metal into the 21st century, is Japanese metal royalty and known for his contribution to countless compositions and production for Japan’s leading musicians and anime’s.

He’s previously released two albums under the Nozomu Wakai’s Destinia name, 2014’s Requiem For A Scream and 2015’s Anecdote Of The Queens.

Nozomu recruited Ronnie Romero at Loud Park 16 (Japan’s biggest rock festival) after being blown away with his performance during Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow’s set.

He then played Mendoza and Aldridge some material from the new project and both were blown away, taking no convincing to sign on!

Highly praising his talents, Ronnie, Marco and Tommy joined forces with Nozomu. I was impressed the moment I listened to his tracks, says Ronnie.

Nozomu is an incredibly talented guitar player and an amazing composer. In addition to that, my vocals fit in really well. Nozomu describes the musical directions and aspirations of Destinia as 'classic modern' heavy metal, adding,

The music goes beyond the authentic hard rock and heavy metal in the same vein as Rainbow, Whitesnake and Dio - it is completed with the contemporary, modern sound styles. I am confident that I can create new music with these musicians.

Nozomu's love of authentic metal is apparent from the get-go with album title track and opener Metal Souls.

The emotional guitars and soaring vocals complement each other perfectly and are backed by the powerful grooves of Aldridge and Marco Mendoza.

Nozomu sees Destinia as a long-term project stating that there are 'songs that need to be written, developments that need to be made and much more metal to be heard! 'Behold the new guitar hero' the new world standard in hard rock and heavy metal.
