Grunge and glamour collide with classic rock roots on&nbsp;*The Black River*&nbsp;– a record which sounds like it could only have been conceived in a cell by none other than The Jailbirds. Over the course of the last three years, the power trio – consisting of the intricate guitar work and powerful vocals from Myke Penney, the sludgy bass lines of Liam Hills, and the pounding drums of Eric Parent – have performed extensively across Ontario demonstrating, both in the studio and on the stage; they’re a band you simply must hear.

Winners of Best Rock Band at the 2018 Mississauga Music Awards, The Jailbirds have a sound that is equally influenced by classic rock, grunge and modern rock icons. Released on January 25 2019,&nbsp;*The Black River*&nbsp;has drawn comparisons to the likes of Black Sabbath, Soundgarden, Royal Blood and Alter Bridge, among others. The EP was recorded in 2017 with Matt Grady at London, Ontario’s EMAC Studios. Through the course of only four songs, The Jailbirds established themselves one of the most promising up and coming independent bands Canada has to offer with a sound that is equally rooted in the rock and roll of today as it is in that of the ‘70s and ‘80s.

2019 has proved to be a huge year for the band. Beyond releasing their debut studio EP, The Jailbirds have received much praise for their work, while being compared to some of their greatest influences. While being critically acclaimed, and even featured on the Hamilton/Burlington based radio network, Y108 Rocks\!, the record and band have received a phenomenal response from their dynamic live performance. Having cut their teeth on the road, The Jailbirds have spent a majority of the first half of the year touring extensively throughout Ontario and Quebec in support of&nbsp;*The Black River*, most notably including a set at this year’s Voodoo Rockfest near Kingston, Ontario.&nbsp;&nbsp;

As they continue to tour in support of&nbsp;*The Black River*&nbsp;throughout 2019, The Jailbirds have signed with Golden Robot Records (Skid Row, The Lazys, Gilby Clarke) where they will officially release and distribute&nbsp;*The Black River* internationally, along with releasing music videos for “The Black River” and “Black Madonna”. As the band continues to further promote&nbsp;*The Black River*, The Jailbirds have begun working on their follow up EP.&nbsp;
