The wait is finally over for fans of The Superjesus! 2016 brought the release of the 'Love and Violence' EP following a stellar return to the live circuit after a ten year hiatus.<br><br>Following an overwhelming reaction to a one-off reunion show in their hometown of Adelaide, The Superjesus have since completed a sold out national headline tour, sold out national co-headline tours with Baby Animals and The Tea Party, and shared festival stages with Van Halen, Aerosmith and Bryan Adams.<br><br>With 3 x ARIA Awards and multi platinum albums; Sumo, Jetage, Rock Music and hit singles Gravity, Secret Agent Man, Shut My Eyes, Down Again and more, The Superjesus are no doubt one of Australia’s most successful and respected rock bands who remain a staple on Aussie rock radio. They have expertly managed to bridge the gap between their instantly recognisable late 90s hits and their current melodic rock sound – bringing together new fans and those who’ve been loyal for 20 years.<br><br>In March 2017, The Superjesus were inducted into the South Australian Music Hall Of Fame<br><br>2018 then kicked off with a mighty bang seeing the band touring the country along side Jebadiah, Killing Heidi ,Dallas Frasca and Grinspoon on the Hotter Than Hell tour. <br><br>This was closely followed by Sarah starring in Green Day’s American Idiot the musical, sharing the role of St Jimmy with Magic Dirts Adalita and Grinspoons Phil Jamieson to rave reviews around the country. <br><br>Today The Superjesus have announced they are playing with fellow 90’s rockers Spiderbait at Luna Park in Sydney on June 10 for the Come Together Festival .<br><br>With an unstoppable work ethic and a 20 year back catalogue to draw from, this mighty machine is now mightier than ever.
