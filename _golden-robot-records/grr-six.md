Fyre &nbsp;Byrd are &nbsp;guitarist/vocalist Joshua &nbsp;and female &nbsp;drummer, Daniella. The &nbsp;brother, &nbsp;sister &nbsp;two piece &nbsp;formed at &nbsp;the beginning &nbsp;of 2017, although they &nbsp;have spent &nbsp;time on the road extensively touring nationally and internationally &nbsp;in other projects.

Based &nbsp;in Adelaide, Fyre &nbsp;Byrd have &nbsp;taken advantage &nbsp;of the chemistry &nbsp;they have built over &nbsp;the years and &nbsp;make their presence &nbsp;known with animalistic drums &nbsp;and heavily &nbsp;distorted guitar &nbsp;that drive the melodic &nbsp;energy of their songs, &nbsp;alongside Joshua's vocals.

The Australian &nbsp;duo's sound &nbsp;moulds the rock &nbsp;dynamism &nbsp;of the likes &nbsp;of The White Stripes &nbsp;and Muse. "From &nbsp;the opening &nbsp;track, there was &nbsp;no doubt in our minds &nbsp;these rockers weren’t &nbsp;just here &nbsp;to play a set, &nbsp;they wanted to leave &nbsp;us gasping for air as they &nbsp;sucked &nbsp;it &nbsp;from &nbsp;our lungs! &nbsp;There were no &nbsp;nerves on stage &nbsp;as Fyre Byrd tore &nbsp;through &nbsp;their set, &nbsp;song after song &nbsp;bringing high energy, electrifying &nbsp;rock and roll &nbsp;for the generation &nbsp;of today.” - All &nbsp;Over Adelaide
