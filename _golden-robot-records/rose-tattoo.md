In the category of ́cult bands\` Rose Tattoo has been at the top of the pile since 1976. Their raw style of blues rock that the Australians manage to create out of a hot mix of slide guitars, pounding hooks with sharp and tight rhythm, along with the unmistakable voice of their front man,

Angry Anderson, is what gives the fans a welcome feast in what is today a fast food orientated music business built around TV shows. Their sound is hard rock mixed with blues rock influences, with songs including "Bad Boy for Love", "Rock 'n' Roll Outlaw", "Nice Boys", "We Can't Be Beaten" and "Scarred for Life".

Their first four albums were produced by Harry Vanda and George Young who also worked with AC/DC. They disbanded in 1987, subsequently reforming briefly in 1993 to support Guns N' Roses on an Australian tour. They reassembled again from 1998 and have since released two more studio albums. One thing about Rose Tattoo is the band can take a punch and are full of vitality. They put every kick in the face behind them and still have the energy to carry on and deliver a new quality product. More than ever, with all that’s going on, we are finding humans of the world who need a voice and no one fills that gap better than the voice of Rose Tattoo.

According to Australian rock music historian Ian McFarlane, Rose Tattoo are "one of the most revered bands of all time. The Tatts played peerless, street-level heavy blues with the emphasis on slide guitar and strident lyric statements".

Guns N' Roses, L.A. Guns, Keel, Nashville Pussy, Motosierra, Pud Spuke, Helen Schneider, and the Uruguayan band, The Knight's Night, have covered Rose Tattoo songs and on 16 August 2006, they were inducted into the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Hall of Fame.

Six former members have died in recent years, including four of the original recording line-up; Dallas Royall (1991), Peter Wells (2006), Ian Rilen (2006), Mick Cocks (2009), and Lobby Loyde (2007), who was a member between October 1979 and September 1980, and Neil Smith (2013), who played bass temporarily prior to Loyde.

Angry and the Tatts are looking now at the future with a worldwide record deal signed with premier Rock and Roll label Golden Robot Records to re-release Blood Brothers and a live album from 1982, Tatt’s: Live in Brunswick, when the band was strong, fierce, dangerous and above all, tight.

Blowing the minds of all fans, young and old, the Tatts are also set to tour extensively on the back of their upcoming release. It’s been many years since they formed, but they’re ready to return and once again, be the voice of a generation in need. Anyone in doubt is reminded of "Revenge", written in 1982 from their Scarred for Life album.
