In late 2017 / early 2018 a brand new line up of Rose Tattoo embark on a triumphant European tour , In Angry’s words The wise amongst us have always said ”never say never” so with the spirit of that in mind..’here we go again!’.<br>I’m very excited to be going out again as Rose Tattoo, 100% adrenalin fueled Aussie rock ‘n’ fucking roll, played in the traditional Aussie way with passion and total commitment to the moment.<br><br>As there is no permanent Rose Tattoo line up at the moment, until Demarco gets out of jail , I have assembled the finest bunch of rogues, worthy to wear the colours, to accompany me into the fray.<br><br>Dai Pritchard on slide off course, in my eyes he has no equal.<br>Second guitar is Bob Spencer, a monster of a player, one of the greatest players I have ever seen and has been a close friend, brother and ally for the past forty years.<br>Mark Evans on bass, his pedigree is enshrined in Aussie rock history.<br>Keeping the seat warm for Demarco is the legendary drummer John ‘Watto’ Watson, another monster of a player, together the boys and I will continue Rose Tattoo’s legacy.<br><br>You the loyal supporters and you the newly found friends deserve nothing but the best and that’s just what you will get .. The Tatts are backed all the way by Golden Robot Records with the release of Live in Brunswick in 2017 followed by a remastered version of Blood brothers in 2018 and a new box set called Scarred for lIve featuring some iconic concerts from 1980 to 1982 , there will be several more releases in 2019 , keeping the flag raised high and the legacy proudly continuing.
