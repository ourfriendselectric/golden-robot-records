Sunny melodies, scorching Detroit guitars and a DIY attitude...It is this ethos that has allowed Bondi Beach’s New Trends to rattle the keys to the Australian Punk Rock kingdom since 2015. Taking their name from The Young Identities world class ep - New Trends began igniting the Sydney punk rock scene off the back of their impressive debut album Gimme Everything, featuring eleven hits of their own as well as classics by The Dead Boys and Agent Orange.

Gimme Everything’s cover art pays homage to American radio DJ Rodney on the Roq as well as their love for Californian punk rock and features one of the greatest record collections going around.

New Trends are influenced by the many known and unknown bands from around the globe which is reflected in their unique sound. In their short career New Trends have gained immediate respect and have already shared the stage with some of the world's finest, including Iggy Pop, Television, Bad Religion, OFF!, Agent Orange, Pennywise, The Adicts, Cock Sparrer, The Weirdos, The Sonics and many, many more.

Whether New Trends are playing International festivals or the local pub they are always ready to entertain and crank up the intensity, so be prepared to dust off those boots and get ready to pick up change, creepy crawl and do your best Huntington Bondi Beach strut with Australia’s finest Punk Rock outfit.
