**Hookers & Blow,** the now legendary project formed by longtime **Guns N' Roses** keyboardist **Dizzy Reed** and **Quiet Riot** guitarist **Alex Grossi**, have entered the recording studio to record a covers album set for a 2019 release via The world’s fastest growing independent record label, **Golden Robot Records.**

"We have been asked for years about putting out an actual recording since we started this thing in 2003," says **Alex Grossi**. "It never really made sense until now, as we have actually found the perfect record label in **Golden Robot Records** - They actually get *"IT"* as far as what **Hookers & Blow** is all about, so we have decided to go for it and are currently in the studio tracking an album of some of our favourite tunes, with some of our favourite people and just having FUN with it. We can't fucking wait to share some of what we have planned for this thing." The band has tapped producer Alistair James who recently worked with **Joe Perry, Alice Cooper** and **Johnny Depp** on the newest **Hollywood Vampires** album.

In 2013 **Hookers & Blow** hosted two back to back highly successful residencies st the world famous **Whisky A Go Go** in Hollywood and in 2018 celebrated it's 15th anniversary with two extensive tours headlining their own 25 city **Holiday Hangover Tour** in January, as well as supporting **The Dead Daisies** on their first headline trek of North America, which kicked off on August 15th in Cleveland, OH, and wrapped in Hollywood on September 16th with a sold out show at The Roxy Theatre in Hollywood, CA.

Over the past 15 years **Hookers & Blow's** past members have included **Todd Kerns (Slash), Chip Z' Nuff (Enuff Z' Nuff), Mike Dupke (WASP), Scott Griffin (LA Guns)** as well as comedian **Don Jamieson of VH1's "THAT METAL SHOW"** among others.

In addition to **Reed** and **Grossi,****Hookers & Blow's** current line-up includes **Johnny Kelly (Type O Negative, Danzig**), **Robbie Crane (Black Star Riders)** and **Nadja Reed.**
