Asteroid B-612 were an Australian hard rock band, which formed in 1992. They released four studio albums, *Asteroid B-162* (1993), *Forced into a Corner* (1994), *Not Meant for this World* (October 1996) and *Readin' Between the Lines* (2000), before disbanding in 2004.

The band's line-up of Michael Gibbons on guitar, Grant McIver on lead vocals, Scott Nash on bass guitar, Darren Pierce on drums and John Spittles on guitar, According to Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, they were "playing its brand of hard-edged Detroit-inspired 'sonic rock action'… Without falling prey to the pitfalls of such an established form, the band overlaid its bedrock of raunchy 12 bar blues with textbook riffs and searing, dual lead guitar workouts."

By late 1994 Stewart Cunningham (ex-the Proton Energy Pills, Brother Brick) had replaced Gibbons on guitar and Ben Fox replaced Pierce on drums to record their second album, *Forced into a Corner*. It was co-produced by Spittles, Lindsay Gravina and Dave Thomas for Destroyer Records, distributed by Shock Records, at Birdland Studios, Melbourne. The group signed with Melbourne-based label, Au Go Go Records, which issued their five-track extended play, *Teen Sublimation Riffs*, in 1995. The group toured the United States supporting garage rockers, Gas Huffer – Cunningham left in mid-tour – late in 1996.

The group's 'third and best album', *Not Meant for this World*, appeared in October 1996 and had been recorded with Cunningham before he left. Mike DaRonco of [AllMusic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AllMusic) observed, "On top of their added approach of angst and speed, \[provided their\] take on a grittier, straight forward approach of rock 'n' roll in the vein of The Stooges, Blue Oyster Cult and The New York Dolls."

After the album appeared Ken Watts (ex-Valvolux) joined on guitar and they continued touring in early 1997. McIver left during that year and was replaced by John's brother, Grahame Spittles on lead vocals. In November 1997 they released a single, "September Crush", with the members adopting performance names, Ben "Barn Stormer" Fox, Scott "Galveston" Nash, "Deluxe" Grahame Spittles, Johnny "Casino" Spittles and Ken "the Killer" Watts. A six-track EP, *Different Licks for Different Chicks*, followed in February 1999 on Rambling Records.

They recorded their fourth studio album, *Readin' Between the Lines* (2000), with Kent Steadman (of Celibate Rifles) producing for Full Toss Records. I-94 Bar's Roberto Calabro felt, "\[it's\] a great collection of songs. A record that opens the sonic possibilities of this band, going from the unbeatable hi-energy rock 'n' roll trademark to psychedelic numbers, from hard-driven mid-tempo to melodic songs with continuity." The group disbanded in 2004.

Golden Robot Records is more than honoured via its direct association with Johnny (Spittles) Casino over many years to offer all the incredible albums, EPs, compilation albums and singles released by the band previously and now available for the first time on all digital platforms. Asteroid B-612 has a well deserved and rightful place in Australian rock history right up there with Radio Birdman, Hoodoo Gurus and The Sunnyboys.
