<br>"THE NEW STRANGE” &nbsp;may very well be one of the most appropriately named projects to come along in a while.

The music industry is currently in a very interesting place, slowly evolving with technology at the helm, yet nobody is 100% really sure where it's going.&nbsp;

If necessity is the mother of invention, one would venture to guess that she also breeds her share of creativity...

"THE NEW STRANGE" &nbsp;is a unique musical partnership between James Durbin (of American Idol fame) and Alex Grossi (best known as the longtime guitarist for legendary hard rock band Quiet Riot). Individually Alex and James have worked with Walt Disney, Touchstone Pictures, FX, NBC, VH1, ABC, FOX and many others writing original material, as well re-working existing tracks to fit with the producer or director's vision. The duo's initial demos made the rounds quickly and found themselves working on two tracks for Warner Brothers "The LEGO Ninjago Movie" .&nbsp;

"INTO THE NIGHT"

After hearing the Benny Mardones classic “Into The Night” &nbsp;playing on a Waffle House jukebox , James and Alex on a whim, decided to take a stab at recording a “Rock” version of the 2x hit song. Upon hearing their rough mix, it was clear that what they ended up with, was more than just a simple “re-make” and sent the track to Mardones himself.

States Benny Mardones: “James Durbin & Alex Grossi have done something that NO other artist ever has done with my “Into The Night ”. “They found the key to making it an honest to God rock ballad. I am simply over the moon!”

“Into The Night” &nbsp;is unusual for being one of only 10 recordings in history to ever ascend to the Top 20 of Billboard Hot 100 chart twice & to this day is one of the top 25 most played songs on American radio.

"It Is what it is, and it will be what it will be...."

“With this project, we haven’t set out to do anything more than what WE want to do, not what we think will make other people like it" says Durbin. “It’s nice to do something that reminds you why you got into this crazy business to begin with" ,&nbsp;adds Grossi. “I’d consider what we’re doing to be more of an idea or a concept than an actual "band - the refreshingly unique way that this whole came about has been very inspiring, both artistically and professionally."

GOLDEN ROBOT RECORDS &nbsp;is excited to be releasing what could very well be the hat-trick for “Into The Night” &nbsp;along with the original, arena-ready partner-single “Goodnight.&nbsp;

&nbsp;Ladies & Gentlemen, there's a NEW STRANGE &nbsp;in town....
