When in 1990 the Guns N’ Roses matured beyond their aggressive hard rock sound, it was the addition of keyboardist Dizzy Reed and the epic tones of the Hammond B-3 that drove this stylistic evolution. After more than 25 years as a powerhouse in Guns N’ Roses, Reed signed with Golden Robot Records, releasing his highly anticipated solo album “Rock ‘N Roll Ain’t Easy” in 2018.

Born in 1960s Hinsdale, Illinois and raised in Colorado, Dizzy Reed had a natural affinity for the keys as his grandmother taught him to play the organ on her electric Lowrey. Listening to the keyboard sections on his father’s Booker T and the MGs, his passion was ignited and at age 12 he began touring with his own elementary school band. By 1985, Dizzy had immersed himself in the insanity of the booming Los Angeles music scene.

“It was the place to be. There were thousands of bands from all over the world, trying to be the next big thing. There was an incredible amount of energy and it was magic.”

It was as part of the club band The Wild in the late 1980s, rehearsing and living in a Hollywood practice room, where he first met the Guns N’ Roses. After befriending Axl, he joined the band in 1990, providing keyboards, piano and backing vocals on the Use Your Illusion albums. However, moving from a club band to one of the biggest stadium rock bands was no easy task. To match the hard rock sound, he would need something more than keyboards and pianos, he would need his signature Hammond B-3 organ. With the Hammond appearing on tracks like “Yesterday” and his backing vocals on rock epics like “November Rain”, Reed added the sense of grandeur that took Guns N’ Roses to that next level.

In 2012, he was inducted into the Rock N’ Roll Hall of Fame as part of Guns N’ Roses. However, his resume extends well beyond this, having toured with the Psychedelic Furs and having toured, recorded and written with supergroup The Dead Daisies. He currently lives in LA with his wife and four children, dedicating time to his main side project, hard rock cover band Hookers & Blow. With his first solo album releasing through Golden Robot Records, Dizzy Reed remains in the rock industry’s ‘sharky’ waters, continuously growing as an individual and flourishing as an artist.

“Never stop learning and exploring, but don’t forget what you do best. Stick to your guns.”
