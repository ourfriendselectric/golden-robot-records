Palm Ghosts is a band based in Nashville led by songwriter / producer Joseph Lekkas.

Having spent the early aughts playing in Philadelphia bands such as Grammar Debate\! and Hilliard, Joseph took a long hiatus from writing and performing music to book shows and festivals in Philadelphia.

Palm Ghosts began in early 2013 as a creative outlet for dealing with a severe bout of depression and anxiety that left him incapacitated. Discovering that music was his only path through the mire, Joseph spent a particularly long Philadelphia winter recording a batch of introspective songs that was to become the first Palm Ghosts record, a tapestry of lo-fi indie folk and dreamy pop he christened *Sun-damaged American music.*

After a short tour in 2013 supporting the release of the first record, Joseph packed up his belongings and headed south to Nashville to take part in the southern city’s musical renaissance.

Joseph set up a small home studio in the guest bedroom of a rental house on Greenland Ave in East Nashville. Two years later, in February of 2017, he released *Greenland*, Palm Ghosts’ second record, consisting of 15 songs that walk the line of electronic, folk and indie music, a collection clearly influenced by the song-is-king culture of his newly adopted city.

In May of 2017, Joseph began work on his next project, a cinematic dream pop / dark indie LP celebrating his favorite sounds from the most colorful of musical decades, the 1980s. Influenced by groups such as Cocteau Twins, Peter Gabriel, Dead Can Dance, New Order and The Cure, he began sketching song ideas to create the lush, cinematic arrangements he was hearing in his head. The fruit of his labors, *Architecture*, is now complete\!

Also, for the first time since 2014, Palm Ghosts is performing live, featuring Joseph Lekkas, Ben Douglas, Jason Springman and Rene Lambert.
