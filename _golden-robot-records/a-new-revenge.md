Every so often members from various bands will collaborate as part of a new project. Every so often, these members are of such high esteem that only the term "supergroup" does this new project justice. Signing to Golden Robot Records in 2018, A New Revenge is a new supergroup, ready to assault audiences with their aggressive hard rock sound and unique brand of metal.

The group consists of guitarist Keri Kelli, whose versatile and adaptive guitars has featured with acts like Slash's Snake Pit, Alice Cooper and Vince Neil Band, bassist Rudy Sarzo, whose legendary and revered bass playing has graced Ozzy Osbourne, Whitesnake, Quiet Riot and Dio, long-time Scorpions drummer James Kottak, whose rhythmic talents have appeared with bands Montrose and Warran, and one of the finest metal voices of all time Tim 'Ripper' Owens, heard on albums by Judas Priest, Iced Earth and Yngwie Maimsteen. Combining Keri's screeching guitar riffs, James thunderous booming drums, Rudy's raw thumping bass and Tim's soaring vocal howl, A New Revenge is kicking down the door of modern rock, bringing their veteran experience to reinvigorate the music scene. Years of heavy metal has hardened their sound and now this supergroup is ready to push rock to new heights.
