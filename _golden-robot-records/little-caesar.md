Nobody quite  knew what to think  of these long haired,  tattooed  bikers singing such soulful, yet  ballsy, rock music  when they  arrived  on the scene  in Los Angeles in 1987. They stood  out amongst  the "Hair Bands"  that populated the music scene at the time… a distinction the  band wore as a badge  of honour.<br><br>Much hype surrounded  the band as they were  managed by  music  legend Jimmy Iovine, guided  by legendary A&R man  John Kalodner  and produced by  Bob Rock. It seemed  like a formula  for success,  yet the band met  an unfortunate set of circumstances  that left many  scratching their heads  shortly  after  the release  of their self-titled  debut album.

Many  were to  speculate  why the band  never achieved the  level of success  that their  legendary team of backers took as inevitable.

Many were to  speculate that  it was due to the  dichotomy between  the band's gruff appearance  and their sound. The truth was  that the  band fell prey  to an unfortunate set of circumstances  that occurred  in the limited  window that bands get to produce  sales in,  or get exiled  in the music business.

Three weeks into  the bands initial  release, Geffen Records  was sold,  their label Manager left the  company, accountants took  over, and  their records  where lost in transit to their new distributors.  As sales dropped  off due to the lack of product availability,  the accountants  shut the project  down.  And  so, another  band dies… there's  always more where they  came from in the rough and  tumble world  that is the music  business.

Little Caesar  first appeared on Metal Blade’s “Street  Survivors” compilation.  The band then  released a four  song EP titled “Name  Your Poison”(produced  by Joe Hardy  of ZZ Top fame),  which subsequently led  to a  deal with  Geffen Records. Little Caesar’s  eponymous  1990 Geffen  debut was produced  by the infamous  Bob Rock  (producer of  Metallica’s self-titled  1991 multi-platinum  release, Motley Crue's “Dr.  Feelgood”,  and  The Cult’s “Sonic  Temple” among  others).  The album was a no-nonsense  collection of hard rock  in the vein  of’70s  giants  like Bad Company and  Humble Pie, and  was also  brimming  with classic  R&B influences,  garnering widespread  acceptance  and positive  reviews from the  rock media. It also featured two Motown  covers, including  a ballsy rendition  of the  classic Aretha Franklin track, “Chain  of Fools,” which hit  the Billboard  Top 100 chart and received strong airplay  nationwide  on both rock  radio and MTV.  The group toured extensively  opening for such legendary acts as Jane’s  Addiction,  KISS, Social Distortion, Iggy  Pop, Billy Idol, and  Lynyrd Skynyrd.  They also  headlined their  own club tours, and  appeared  on TV’s  popular “Arsenio  Hall Show”, “The  Rick Dee’s Show”,  and  MTV’s “Sex in the  90’s”. Vocalist  Ron Young  was also featured in the movie “Terminator  2” as  a tough talking biker  that gets  into a fight  with the film’s star,  Arnold Schwarzenegger.  1992 would bring the second  full-length  album, “Influence”, which  would have  Earl Slick (of John Lennon, David  Bowie, and  Ian Hunter  fame) replacing  Apache on guitar.

The “Influence” album  was produced  by the highly  respected Howard Benson (who has recently  produced releases  for platinum  artists like  Daughtry, Papa  Roach, and P.O.D.  among  others).  The band completed  its first tour of Europe after the release  of the album  and drew rave reviews  and sold out  crowds  across multiple countries including  a sold out headlining  performance at  the famous Marquee club in London.

As the band  slowly recovered  from the shock and  lessons learned  in the nasty world of the music  business, they always  remained  close, as  they are a  family way before  they  are a  band. They  started to do  local shows and  remember why they loved  music and each  other. Since the  reformation, the  band has  played high profile shows  at venues as House of  Blues,  California  Speedway for  NASCAR, and the  Rock The Bayou  Festival  in Houston  TX.

In 2010,  Little Caesar  moved forward with  a vengeance  on a worldwide  level with a release  titled "Redemption"  as well as  touring  in the US,  Europe and the  UK and in 2012,  Little  Caesar  released  "American Dream".  Produced by Bruce Witkin, a powerful,  no nonsense, guitar  driven group of songs  that takes  the band to  that same warm  R&B driven  Rock and  Roll Universe  they call home.  They performed at  the  Hard  Rock Hell  festival in  Wales in Dec  2012. They returned once  again to Europe in 2013  appearing at The  Download Festival  appearing alongside  such acts as Iron Maiden, Motorhead,  Rival Sons,  and Queens of  the Stone Age. In 2016. Bass player Pharoah Barrett  (The Four Horsemen) joined founding  members Ron Young (Vocals),  Tom Morris (Drums)  and Loren  Molinare  (Guitar) and  they released a double  live CD titled “Brutally  Honest” which  authentically  captured the band’s  live  energy.

In  2017  the band  has continued  touring the US,  UK and  Europe and  entered the studio  to work with Bruce Witkin  again for  their upcoming  release on Golden Robot Records.  Joining the  band on Guitar  is Mark Tremalgia  (BangTango, Chambers  Brothers, Brothers  Johnson) whose band “Disreputable  Few” has  been backing  great artists Billy  Gibbons, Slash and Butch  Trucks.  The band  has upcoming  tours in  the UK  and Europe  to support their  5th studio  album and  7th release.
