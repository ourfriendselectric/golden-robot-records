Since releasing their wildly successful EP, Breaking Out, and debut album NOVA, UK rock trio RavenEye has toured globally, including as direct support for Slash w/ Myles Kennedy (US and Europe), KISS (European arena tour, May 2017), BUSH (Europe), Aerosmith (Lisbon),

The Darkness (US), Halestorm (Europe) and Deep Purple (Europe). The band has headlined their own tours through Europe and America, as well as performing at major international rock festivals such as Download Festival (UK), Rock Im Ring (Germany), Rock Am Park (Germany), Reading & Leeds (UK) Hellfest Open Air Festival (France), Azkena Rock Festival ARF (Spain), Rock For People (Czech Republic), Louder Than Life (U.S.),

Aftershock Festival (U.S.), Maximus Festival (Brazil and Argentina) Their incendiary live shows have captivated crowds and put them on the map as a ‘must see live’ band.

The band has just confirmed a full UK headline tour for February/March 2019. RavenEye is also making its second appearance on Shiprocked in January 2019. Extensive US and European tours and festivals are being scheduled throughout 2019.

RavenEye released an EP, “Breaking Out” (2015), and its debut Album, “NOVA” (2016). Both are available on Spotify. Singles from NOVA include

“Hero”, “Inside” and “Madeline”. Both records received great press, including in Kerrang, Planet Rock, Loudwire, etc. Solid radio support in the UK and Germany and a solid impact at US (active rock) Radio. After writing more than 20 new songs, the band has just entered the studio in the UK to record its follow-up to its debut album.

“This could be the start of something very big indeed” - Classic Rock “Blues rock riffs that slither their way into your brain” - Kerrang

“Hairs-on-the-back-of-your-neck hard rock epic you’ll thank yourself for finding” - The Sun “Keep an eye on RavenEye. They are organic, raw and I hear a real‘70s influence with these guys. When a band like this nails it, you never forget it. Wait for that riff in the middle of the song.” – Nikki Sixx

When RavenEye formed three and one-half years ago, the then 25 year old, Oli Brown, singer and multi-award winning guitarist, had already released four solo albums and toured the world for 10 years with legends such as Jeff Beck, Buddy Guy, Johnny Winter and Joe Satriani. Mojo even hailed Oli as “the hottest young pistol in British blues” and Classic Rock Magazine described him as "one of the best and brightest guitar heroes performing in the world today." RavenEye’s live performances take their present and future fans on a journey to the next level.
