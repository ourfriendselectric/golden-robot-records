A wise man once said it

s long way to the top if you want to rock

Ǯ

n

ǯ

roll. If you

ǯ

re

The Lazys

, it

ǯ

s

more like a long way across two continents and the world

ǯ

s

largest ocean. But since the Australian rockers have landed on Canadian shores

,

it

ǯ

s been a balls-out ascent to become one of the most talked about live acts in the

country. And they

ǯ

ve now bottled that lighting on their new album,

Tropical

Hazards

.

Co

-written by Ian D

ǯ

Sa (Billy Talent) and produced by D

ǯ

Sa and Eric Ratz (Big

Wreck, Danko Jones, Monster Truck)

,

Tropical Hazards

is a high-octane, hell-

raising rock

Ǯ

n

ǯ

roll riot that picks up right where

The Lazys

left off in 2015 with

their Top 10 singles

Dz

Sh

ake it Like You Mean It

dz

and

Dz

Black Rebel

.

dz

When those songs first smashed onto radio, fans could be forgiven for thinking

they were hearing a brand new band. Fact is, these guys had been paying the

ir

dues back in Australia since 2006, where Leon Harrison and Mat

ty

Morris met

while playing in local garage bands

.

Dz

He was singing and playing guitar in a band

and so was I,

dz

recalls Leon.

Dz

But I was a better singer. He was a better guitar

player. So we joined forces.

dz

The Lazys

released a few EPs before packing bags

and heading for New York City to record a new record. Then things took a

surprising turn

in

Toronto

at

Canadian Music Week.

Dz

To be honest, we took the risk of our lives,

dz

explains Leon, of coming to play the

festival

.

Dz

We had three shows booked in 24 hours

.

The first was 3 a.m. at the

Horseshoe. We went out on stage and did what we had done for 10 years at

home to 10 people but it just started a buzz. Something had clicked.

dz

Their

second gig attracted prominent booking agent Ralph James, who signed them o

n

the spot! At their third, Ian D

ǯ

S

a,

guitarist for Billy Talent, who became an instant

fan and soon a collaborator. The band and D

ǯ

Sa

co

-wrote

Dz

Shake it Like You Mean

It

dz

and

Dz

Black Rebel

dz

over Skype between Australia and Canada, then recorded

the tracks in Vancouver with GGGarth Richardson (Rage Against The Machine,

Nickelback, Red Hot Chili Peppers). The songs were added to the already

completed self-titled album

,

and released on Pheromone Recordings (Joel

Plaskett, The Dears).

Dz

And they went Top 10. Which is crazy,

dz

says Mat

ty

.

Dz

From

all of that, we built a relationship with Ian, then decided to do a full album

together.

dz

Tropical Hazards

was written in Canada and Australia throughout 2017,

including months of gruelling pre-production where the band and D

ǯ

Sa (who the

guys refer to as the sixth member of the band) would painstakingly craft ly

rics

together.

Dz

He wouldn

ǯ

t settle for a one-hour brainstorm on one line,

dz

says Leon.

Dz

He

ǯ

d settle for a day.

dz

The result is 10 tracks that

ǯ

s unabashedly outrageous,

packed with songs about wild nights, pretty girls, heartbreak, and r

esilience that

are classic, but never clich&eacute;.

Opening track and lead single

Dz

Nothing But Trouble

dz

sets the tone: a spirited ode

to

a

particular type of

Dz

raging bull

dz

rebel that reveals the influence of classic

Aussie rockers like AC/DC and The Angels and may also possibly be a bit

biographical.

Dz

The image popped in my head of like a guy like Bon Scott,

dz

says

Leon.

Dz

Someone who never pushed it too far, but definitely gave it a good knock.

Kind of like us after a night of drinking! We never get arrested but we sure hav

e a

good time.

dz

The high-voltage riffage continue

on

tracks like

Dz

Can

ǯ

t Kill the Truth,

dz

Dz

Take Back

the Town

dz

and

Dz

Louder Than Youth,

dz

a song about defiance towards teachers

who abuse authority, directly inspired by Leon

ǯ

s growing up in the private

Catholic school system. Then there

ǯ

s the wink-wink, nudge-nudge of

Dz

Half Mast

Blues,

dz

a rollicking tale of a pirate and his

...

well, listen and you

ǯ

ll

figure it out

...

If this makes The Lazys sound a bit cocksure, it

ǯ

s because they are

—

Tropical

Hazards

spits and swaggers with the best rock records. But there

ǯ

s more to the

band than middle fingers and beers in the air.

Dz

Somebody

ǯ

s Daughter

dz

offers a

different vibe altogether, a comment on missing and murdered Indigenous

Women, a problem that plagues both Canada and Australia. And the stand-out

track

Dz

Young Modern Lightning

dz

is an emotionally charged, candid account of the

realities of being in a touring band for 10 years

—

and the breakdown of

relationships and heartbreak that often result. As much as any fast guitar l

ick or

rollicking drum beat, it

ǯ

s this song that reveals The Lazys true commitment to

rock

Ǯ

n

ǯ

roll.

On past tours with bands like The Trews and Danko Jones,

The Lazys

quickly

gained a reputation for their rowdy, high-energy performance. With the r

elease

of

Tropical Hazards

they prepare to hit the road and do what they do best: bring

the party.

Dz

I want people to leave feeling entertained,

dz

says Matty

.

Dz

I

want them

to leave thinking that was the best rock show they

ǯ

ve

ever seen. To leave sweaty,

dirty, horny!

dz

Having recently relocated to Toronto full-time, the band can certainly be

considered honorary Canadians. And the journey that began 10 years ago in

Australia is still just getting started. Says Matty

,

Dz

Since the early days, being in a

rock band is all we

ǯ

ve ever wanted to do. We

ǯ

ve shown how much love we can

offer to people if they give us a chance and Canada has done that for us. It

ǯ

s kind

of insane when we think about all that support. But now it

ǯ

s time to show the
