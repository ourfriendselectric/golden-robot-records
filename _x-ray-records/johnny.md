**Newcastle based crooner turn rocker Johnny has emerged from his hiatus to realise the genre splitting track “Shake It”\!**

**Born and bred in the steel city,&nbsp; Johnny has played every role he can in the Legendary Newcastle Pub Music scene; he’s been a band leader and now he returns out of the ashes of quieter city as a singer/guitarist/songwriter, keeping the flame of the classic Australian sound and tongue in cheek lyricism alive.**
