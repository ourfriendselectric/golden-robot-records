<p>Introducing The Lockhearts – they are loud, obnoxious and demand to be heard. Their rock stylings are dirty, fuzzy and catchy as hell; and they’ve been called bluesy rock, 70’s rock and hard rock. Call it whatever you want - they just prefer to make it known that they play rock ‘n’ roll. Hailing from Sydney’s inner west, these four best friends will go through anything to get on a stage, plug in some vintage gear and play an energetic set of incendiary guitar sounds with mesmerising melodies and bell-bottom swagger. The band, Tim Meaco on vocals and guitar, Sam Sheumack on guitar, Jameel Majam on bass and Steve ‘Woodie’ Woodward on drums; grew up listening to 70’s bands including The Stones, The Faces, Led Zeppelin, Queen and Free mixed in with more contemporary influences like The Hives and The Bronx</p>

<p>The Lockhearts have become a crowd favourite in the Sydney scene, regularly selling out venues with incredible live shows and rambunctious energy. They have toured Australia extensively, and have supported the likes of The Baby Animals, The Meat Puppets, King of the North, Gay Paris and the Hell City Glamours.</p>

<p>The Lockhearts believe music, especially rock ‘n’ roll, is about the inclusive notion that draws different people together - and all they want to do is spread the love.</p>
