Since the 90s, the term ‘Desert Rock’ has been a genre associated with generator parties and searing, sludging, mid-frequency guitar riffing. Bone Acre, emerging from the same scene, ushers in what appears to be a highly anticipated new era. Their live set offers songs intentionally crafted, with meticulous storytelling, while maintaining the spirit of what the high desert embodies; stark uncomfortable stillness, deep rumination, and an undefeated tireless heat.

The band weaves these themes sonically through arrangements that rise, fall, and stretch out like a lone desert highway, putting the song as a whole behind the wheel. Kevin Bronson of Buzzbands put it best, “Bone Acre makes psych-rock that moves like a grass fire, whipped by the winds of Caroline Heerwagen’s intensely personal lyrics and fed by her smoldering vocals.”

Their first album, “Oll Korrect”, recorded at the iconic Rancho De La Luna in Joshua Tree with Dave Catching, shows both sides of a unique and timeless story. Emotionally charged, and ruthless, it offers feelings from all sides, and the music follows suit. When the song needs menace, the guitars lacerate, the bass rumbles, and the drums pound. When the song shifts gears towards a more introspective message - guitars chime, bass takes a back seat, and drums pulse.

Lyrically, the album reflects a weathered and wise experience, in-keeping with its backdrop. Sitting in front of the listener, the story offers both heartbreak and freedom. The narrative of deeply personal stories of perseverance result in vocals that range from wrought cathartic outpourings to exorcise past demons to defiant lived-experiences, and visceral admonishments.

A truly dynamic first work, the spine of its limited edition vinyl reads “Acre One”, leaving its rabid audience wondering what the second Acre has in store.
