Nineteen years ago in a garage in Dapto, three highschool friends with a passion for punk music and surfing, formed the band Under the Influence. UTI played as a 3 piece around the Wollongong music scene with original member Shane Kinerson (Kino) doing main vocals and drumming. On bass was Luke Malone (Moey) and on lead guitar was former member Glen Robinson. In 2009 after several line up changes, Chris Curci joined on bass and Moey jumped on lead guitar. UTI continued playing this line up for the next few years and recorded the album Wasted Youth.

With solid feedback from Wasted Youth, Kino decided to step up his singing game and handed over the drum roll (pun intended) to Daniel Southern (Chicken Wing). Going through UTI's discography you can hear the focus on improving the music and their growth as a band, starting from street punk influences, to heavy punk hardcore. If you have seen or heard under the influence with this high energy combination you will know they are dedicated to the music, nothing is held back and it is raw and intense.

UTI have released their killer debut album in June 2019 on Riot Records "Exchange My Brain" with their first single "Propaganda Leaks" gaining critical acclaim across Australia and Europe. UTI have a full touring schedule across Australia supporting the release for the rest of 2019.
