With each member under the age of 17, The Kids are exactly that, kids. But don’t let their age fool you, because this young punk band with attitude can rock and play hard and aggressive, leading the charge for Aussie punk bands across the globe with authentic original punk songs. Channelling their teenage angst into their music, The Kids’ rage fuelled rock embraces the punk and grunge greats of the past, with their inspirations ranging from Nirvana, Dead Kennedys and Bad Brains, to Generation X, Black Flag and the Sex Pistols. Reinventing punk rock for a new generation, they maintain the rebellious streak the genre is known for, while modernising it through their youth.&nbsp;

Led by prodigy drummer Jagger Alexander-Erber who is already playing with other bands including Moon also on GRR, the band has rocked shows across the world, supporting both national and international acts ranging from Skidrow, LA Guns, Living Colour and Rose Tattoo to name but a few gaining rave reviews from stages at LA’s famous Whisky-a-go-go to The Cherry Bar in Melbourne and everything in between.

At only 16 Jagger has had a life full of experiences. Taking these ups and down in stride, he has written his debut album I Just Wanna Be Happy, set for release via Riot Records which is part of the Golden Robot Global Entertainment Group in 2019. The title track “I Just Wanna Be Happy” and their debut single “School” both with videos was released early in 2018 to rave reviews,

Their new double A side single will be released on July 29 featuring the smash hit "I Thought My Family Was Rich" and a killer cover of Rage Against the Machine's "Killing in the Name". This will be followed by several tours to see out 2019. Don't miss seeing The Kids live. The changing of the guard is upon us - be part of something special.
