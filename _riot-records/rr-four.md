A 90’s child with a micro-chip on her shoulder.<br>Escaper of death and stereotypes.<br>Toured the world in a rock band.<br>Leading role in a Flume video.<br>Run over by a ten tonne truck scratch free.<br>Found salvation in electronica with the jilted generation.<br>Lover of space and dimensional travel.<br>Frequenter of the future.<br>6 out of 9 lives left.<br>Don’t ask questions but you can come if you want to.
