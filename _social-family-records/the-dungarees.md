The Dungarees have been making a splash in the country scene here recently, and in Canada since 2016.

Comprised of bassist/vocalist James Murdoch, guitarist/vocalist Robb Angus, guitarist/vocalist Kiron Jhass, steel player Darrek Anderson and drummer Ben Shillabeer, The Dungarees have a definitive musical mandate; take the undeniable lyrical styling, twangy telecaster and steel guitar that they love from classic country, and inject it with harmony, modern intensity and pop sensibility.

Among Canada’s fastest rising stars, The Dungarees have performed at marquee festivals including Boots and Hearts Music Festival, the Calgary Stampede, Big Valley Jamboree, Country Thunder, Dauphin CountryFest and SunFest and, of course, Australia’s Tamworth Country Music Festival. The Dungarees have previously been nominated for “Group of The Year” at the Alberta Country Music Awards and were honoured to be shortlisted for numerous 2017 Canadian Country Music Awards.

The band has also had the honour to be direct support for country music royalty such as Miranda Lambert, Blake Shelton, Reba McEntire and Dwight Yoakam.
