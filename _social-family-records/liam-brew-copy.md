# **Lachlan Bryan & The Wildes (Distro only)**

**The Road EP**

**The Road**

So sings Lachlan Bryan, with equal parts defiance and resignation, at the very start of new single The Road. His deep, resonant voice – whilst comforting as ever – sounds particularly road weary.

“*I’m a kind of restless person*”, Lachlan explains “*and in my adult life I’ve chosen the road – both literally and figuratively, over just about everything else. That’s really what this song is about – it’s kind of a meditation for all of us restless spirits out there*”.

The Road is the first new music we’ve heard from Lachlan Bryan and The Wildes since 2018’s full-length album Some Girls (Quite) Like Country Music (which was long-listed for The Australian Music Prize and is a finalist in the AIR Awards for Best Independent Country Release). The single was recorded upon Lachlan’s return from a 15 date US Tour and drops as the band embark on a 12 date Australian run through May and early June. In late June, Lachlan and band will head to Port Hedland for the Red Country Music Festival before traveling to the UK for a headline appearance at Maverick Festival and a host of UK and European sideshows.&nbsp;

**Take It Out On Me**

Take it Out on Me is a feel-good, old school pop song, resplendent with jangling guitars, honky-tonk piano, a sing-along chorus and a distinctly “1970s Rolling Stones meets Steeler’s Wheel” vibe. Written by front man Lachlan Bryan with frequent collaborator Rob Draper, the song hints at a couple navigating their way through the metaphorical hangover of a messy weekend.
