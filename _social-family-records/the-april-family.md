# The April Family (Distro only)

**The April Family** have been quietly working away, building a name and a steady body of work since forming in 2015. Featuring the enigmatic Kylie Whitney on lead vocals, the skills of Casey Atkins on lead guitar and backing vocals, and the production and all-rounder abilities of Michael Carpenter on rhythm guitar and backing vocals, the band developed a sound that fused Classic Country with the timeless colours of West Coast American Country Rock.

The live performing experience has further defined the band’s sound, leading to the writing and recording of their second album, currently in production. With a focus on a leaner approach, showcasing a more ‘ensemble’ sound, and the writing from Carpenter and Whitney becoming more refined and deliberate, The April Family have kicked into a higher gear with a clearer focus and more ambitious aesthetic. Armed with a unique series of music videos to accompany the single and album releases, the album promises to show a maturity and intent that will lift the band to the next stage of their journey.
