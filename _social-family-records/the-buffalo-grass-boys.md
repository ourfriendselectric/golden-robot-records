# The Buffalo Grass Boys (Distro only)

The Buffalo Grass Boys are a rocking bunch of guys who play Alt Country/Rockabilly/Country music and hail from Sydney, Australia. With global influences in their style, it’s hard not to hear the difference in what they create. Not content to stick with the norm, The Boys have really tried to come up with something different, fun and energetic, something they’ve become renowned for in their live shows.
