Kirsty Lee Akers is one of Australia's most unique and authentic recording artists. She is a rare talent who is proud of her indigenous heritage as a woman of the Wonnarua nation. Akers describes herself as a fusion of modern Country and Americana, with Pop stylings. While Australia will always be her spiritual home, she spends a lot of her time in North America, having toured both the United States and Canada throughout 2016 and 2017. The year 2018 sees her return to Canada to play two major festivals (Calgary Stampede and Big Valley Jamboree) while also expanding her horizons as she showcases her music in the United Kingdom for the first time(Buckle and Boots Festival).

Akers is the only artist in history to have won the three major prizes in Australian Country Music, Toyota Star Maker, Telstra Road to Discovery and a coveted CMAA Golden Guitar Award. Her last album 'Burn Baby Burn' was released through Maven/Sony Music Australia in 2016 and saw her achieve her highest ever ARIA chart position at #1 on release (ARIA Australian Sales Chart Country Music) as well as producing six consecutive #1 music videos on the Country Music Channel (CMC). Internationally, her single *'I Will'* attracted 150,000 unique video views within 3 days of release and was her first video to be added to both CMT (Country Music Television) and GAC (Great American Country) in the United States.

The last few years have seen Akers achieve many accolades including a Golden Guitar Award Finalist spot in 2017, an APRA Award finalist spot (Radio Airplay Award), Vanda and Young Song writing Competition (Song-writing Award) finalist spot and seven CMC TV Award nominations (2016/2017/2018), she has also been recognised with multiple honourable mentions in the International Song writing Competition (USA).

In April 2018 Kirsty signed a new 2-album record deal with Social Family Records that encompasses her 5th and 6th studio albums. The first of these is entitled *'Under My Skin'* and will be released on July 27, 2018.
