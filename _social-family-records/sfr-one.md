GRETTA ZILLER BIO

First impressions aren't always right. If you've been foolish enough to nail down the

sound of acclaimed songwriter Gretta Ziller, then prepare to have the rug pulled out from under you. Queen of Boomtown, her stunning debut record, defies categorisation and demands repeated listens. Ziller's sound may bear the hallmarks of classic Americana music, but it's essence is far more diverse. The Melbourne songstress roots span jazz, blues, rock, pop and classical, and that eclectic musical upbringing is reflected in the varied tracks on this new collection. Dz I didn't want to make an album that sounded like anything in the Americana scene right now'dz says Ziller. DzI wanted my album to reflect the soundtrack of my childhood, yet sonically and lyrically sound like who I am now. I really wanted to push the boundaries of what country music, or Americana, alt-country whatever you want to call it can sound like. I didn't want to fit neat and tidy into the country music box dz Ziller brought together an impressive array of musicians to perform on Queen of Boomtown, the recordings featuring members of Saskwatch, The Cat Empire, and the bands of Angus & Julia Stone, Passenger and Dan Sultan. Accomplished songwriter Jen Mize provides backing vocals while Henry Wagons appears as a guest on Round and Round. Recorded at Woodstock Studios, Balaclava, the album was produced by New Zealand-born, Melbourne-based singer-songwriter Paul Ruske. Dz Working with Paul was the most amazing experience, dz Ziller recalls. DzNot only is he such a beautiful person and talented musician, but he understood me and what I wanted with this record. dz Ziller and Ruske's combined desire to break the country mould paid off. There's certainly some classic country influence in the gorgeous production of Jude and Go On, but that vanishes quickly on the rock stomper Let It Go or the sparse, aching piano ballad

This is Gonna Hurt and the sultry Whiskey Shivers. Written over an almost six-year period, this collection covers vast emotional territory. No matter the mood, Ziller demonstrates an assured sense of melody, building on the promise of ear-catching 2014 EP Hell’s Half Acre. Round and Round feels like an instant classic, echoing of the great duets from Cash and Carter to Cave and Harvey.For Ziller, the songs are often inspired by emotions rather than common trials and autobiographical tribulations. Dz I approach my songwriting a little bit like a bower bird, dz the songwriter explains. Dz I am a collector of ideas and thoughts. The Notes app in my phone is full of one liners and song ideas. I don't write specifically about everyday stuff in my life, I tend to take an idea or emotion about something that is relevant or emotionally attractive to me and roll with it. dz Queen of Boomtown

is threaded with a gentle fatalism, each song conveying an

acceptance of the way things are and an openness to shifting

circumstance.

Dz

I draw

on the emotion of needing change a lot when I write, I

’

m a person that likes and craves

change

Ziller explains.

DzǮ

Let It Go

ǯ

is about being who you are in the moment and not

holding onto worries

Ǯ

Slaughterhouse Blues

ǯ

is all about wanting something different

,

Ǯ

Alright With Me

ǯ

is about accepting that someone loves you for how wonderfully

imperfect you are

and

Ǯ

This Is Gonna Hurt

ǯ

is about the pain and regret of a breakup

While the album title might appear to be big-noting, one li
