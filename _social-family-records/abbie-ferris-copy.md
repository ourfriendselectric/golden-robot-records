Abbie Ferris is a small-town girl chasing big time dreams. The 18-year-old is a true-blue country girl, having grown up on a 90-acre property on the outskirts of the small South Australian town of Mallala. From an early age, two things were mainstays in Abbie's world, music and horses. With her father working in the sale yards as a stockman, Abbie was on horseback by the time she could walk. Pretty soon after that, she fell in love with music and started working on her craft as a singer-songwriter. Her family recant fond memories of a four-year-old Ferris singing Little Bit Lonesome by Kasey Chambers at her Grandmother's kitchen table.

Flash forward 14 years and that little girl is all grown up and ready to make her dreams into reality. Being awarded the Market the Music 'Emerging Artist Scholarship' in early 2017 led to an appearance on the CMC Awards red carpet wearing a one of a kind RACY & LUCKY gown and then a festival stage debut playing the at the Groundwater Country Music Festival. Abbie has now written with some of the finest songwriters in Australian country music, recording her debut single entitled 'For A Moment', which was added immediately upon release to Spotify's Fresh Country playlist, clocking up more than 200,000 streams to date.  The track was also well received across country radio, added on rotation to the likes of Kix Country and ABC Country, and landing itself a spot on the official Top 50 country airplay chart.  The video clip was added to the Country Music Channel, and straight onto their chart, as well. An outstanding achievement for a debut country single!

Having recently completed her high school studies and cleared the path for her musical passions, there is little doubt that we will be hearing a lot more from Abbie Ferris in the future!
