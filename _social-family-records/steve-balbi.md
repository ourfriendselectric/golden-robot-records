The music of singer, composer, performer and producer Steve Balbi mines a kaleidoscope of life at the margins. Transcending rock and pop as he coalesces sentimentality and soul, Balbi bespeaks Bowie and Dylan in melody and verse, exploring the heterogeneity, refinement and dirty rotten groove of Radiohead.

First cutting his chops on bass with Kevin Borich Express at just 17 years of age, Balbi was very much the child prodigy. Although the creative chameleon's species being was soon liberated as Balbi cultivated an indelible production and song-writing partnership with Justin Stanley; first founding and producing Aussie chart-toppers Noiseworks (1986), before forming the Electric Hippies (1993).

Numerous European tours, four multi-platinum award-winning albums, and various ARIA Award Nominations later, Balbi lifted his guitar from the rack to form Universe with Cathy Green (X) in 1996, working with Prince and Paisley Park’s Susan Rogers, before Move Trees and Moon emerged in subsequent years. Then in 2011, Balbi accepted an invitation to front 1970s and' 80s new-wavers Mi-Sex, who will next year mark the 40th Anniversary of Graffiti Crimes and Computer Games.

Reflecting upon his journey as composer and producer, Balbi's eclectic catalogue of production credits transcend genres, akin to his odyssey as a musician and performer. For the dynamic assemblage of artists that he’s produced includes Noiseworks, Electric Hippies' Glenn Shorrock, Juice, Jenny Morris, Pearls & Swine, Toe to Toe, Vincent Stone, Fyre Byrd, Moon, and Christine Anu, among numerous others. And in 1999, Balbi sat in on vocals and guitar for David Bowie's Hours sessions with Marius de Vries too.

In April this year, the world became a very different place for millions of Australians when Dr Jordan Nguyen and his extraordinary team of dreamers at Psykinetic launched Atmosphere – eye-controlled technology that enables people living with high-level physical disability to use only their eyes to make music. Celebrating yet another world first, Balbi traversed new ground alongside Jessica Irwin to release the single, Winners (Psykinetic Mix), which was recorded with Psykinetic's eye-controlled music software.

Yet it is Balbi's debut solo LP, Black Rainbow (2013), and its subsequent surreal reprise, Rainbow Black (2016), which appears to have set a point of departure for his enigmatic artistry, and manifestation of his forthcoming solo LP- Humans. Inspired by ten photographs from Brandon Stanton's Humans of New York series, Balbi’s second solo endeavour is an eclectic collection of words and music that navigates a wistful path from melancholy through madness.

Casting a renewed focus upon the notion humanity in both riff and verse is the first single' Modern Love’, which is due for release on Friday 26 October; pre-sales from Friday 21 September; with the studio album, Humans, to follow in early 2019.
