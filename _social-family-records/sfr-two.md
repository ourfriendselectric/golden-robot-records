"I was born in a small town "John Cougar Mellencamp sang nearly thirty years ago long before 20 year-old **JASON OWEN** was born and now walks to the same tune.

Growing up in a town of 12 people called Albert in far west NSW (150km from Dubbo) one would think it was lonely. Not at all, with his family and relatives pretty much owning the town (which his Dad saved from extinction), Jason had the perfect childhood. With so much space and land, there were quad bikes, rabbit and clay shooting, building bush cubby-houses and very little chance of getting hit by a bus (although there is the legendary 1947 Albert bus that greets you when you arrive into town).

Most Australians will remember Jason from the 2012 season of The X-Factor. What is not so well known is that Jason's entry into the competition was unplanned and only happened because his aunt wanted to audition for the show but would not go unless Jason accompanied her. He reluctantly drove from Albert to Sydney (5 hours) for the auditions and entered along with her.

As they say, the rest is history. Week after week, Jason surprising himself more than anyone else, kept getting through each round with his honest, sincere and boy next-door personality, but most of all his exceptional voice that has a unique and recognizable timbre. With Mel B as his coach, Jason delivered every week to eventually be in the final round, finishing up as runner-up to Samantha Jade with his performance of Bruce Springsteen’s classic "Dancing in the Dark", (it did help that Bruce Springsteen is one of Jason’s favourite artists.).

In May 2013, his debut album, **Life Is A Highway** (produced by Bry Jones) was released featuring 10 classic covers that Jason grew up with. Tracks from artists such as John Denver, Elvis Presley, Willie Nelson, Tom Cochrane, Bob Seger, Lynyrd Skynrd, Green Day and newcomers The Black Keys to name a few, the album debuted at #5 on the Australian National ARIA Chart and stayed in the Top 10 ARIA Country Album chart for 5 weeks.

The lead track from the album released was a duet with label-mate Amber Lawrence, the Kenny Rogers and Dolly Parton classic **"Islands In the Stream"**. That set in motion a 9-month joint National tour around the country in 2013.

Finding his feet as a recording and touring artist, Jason entered the studio in March 2014 to record his follow-up album, again with hit producer Bry Jones. The album was recorded between Nashville and Sydney and features the cream of musicians from both countries.

Two originals were included on the album to be recorded and first single, **"Damn Right"** popped out as a smash hit. "As soon I heard a rough demo of Damn Right, I knew it was the perfect original and wanted to record it for the album", says Jason.

**"Damn Right"** scheduled for release on the 29th August 2014 will also see Jason embark on a 5 week, 9,500km East Coast of Australia promo performance road-trip, something that doesn’t happen often these days with an artist, such is the importance of this song for Jason and re-connecting with his fans and audience. They’re ready and waiting with Jason posting a funny home music video performance online that was viewed by 45,000 in the space of 24 hours.

**"Friday Night"** is the title of Jason's follow-up, second album to be released in March 2015. It's also the first lyric line of "Damn Right"and sums up the 20 year olds view and that of most people - of always looking forward to Friday night after an exhaustive week.

*"The album is much more up-tempo and fun than the first with an almost rockabilly feel to it in some parts. Its about feeling good and enjoying life and I’ve been a fan of the artist’s that I’ve covered so my heart and soul of appreciation as a fan is in there too", says Jason.*

*The 10 tracker features the original ballad "Tears On Fire" (again written by Adam Reily) plus 8 other covers such as "I Won’t Back Down" (Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers), "Call Me The Breeze" (JJ Cale), "That's Alright" (Elvis Presley),"Crazy Little Thing Called Love" (Queen), "Wanted" (Hunter Hayes), "I'm On Fire" (Bruce Springsteen), "This Ole House" (Shakin, Stevens), "Last Train To Clarksville" (The Monkees)*
