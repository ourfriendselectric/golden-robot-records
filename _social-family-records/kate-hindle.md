# **Kate Hindle (Distro only)**

‘*I’ve got to fail to learn to fly’* is a self-penned lyric and motto that Kate Hindle lives by. Finding the inner strength to keep pushing forward despite failure, is something Hindle understands best. From hospital beds, to learning to walk again despite chronic pain from degenerative disc disease, prove that Kate is a strong-willed young woman.

Hindle’s pain and triumph were the inspiration behind her ‘Ready For The Ride’ mini album released in 2018, the title track a co-write between Hindle and multiple Golden Guitar winner, Lyn Bowtell. A taste of pop country with a powerful theme, Kate says, “*Writing the song from a wheelchair, with a broken heart, the lyrics bloomed from the inspiration of walking again and becoming mentally strong enough to achieve anything*”.

Kate Hindle’s warm vocal tones and raw lyrics take the listener on a journey of love, personal victory, positivity and a yet a touch of heartache.&nbsp; Her new single, ***Heart Bleed***, is no different.
