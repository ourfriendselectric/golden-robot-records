Abbie Ferris is a small-town girl chasing big time dreams. The 18-year-old is a true-blue country girl, having grown up on a 90-acre property on the outskirts of the small South Australian town of Mallala. From an early age, two things were mainstays in Abbie's world, music and horses. With her father working in the sale yards as a stockman, Abbie was on horseback by the time she could walk. Pretty soon after that, she fell in love with music and started working on her craft as a singer-songwriter. Her family recant fond memories of a four-year-old Ferris singing Little Bit Lonesome by Kasey Chambers at her Grandmother's kitchen table.

Flash forward 14 years and that little girl is all grown up and ready to make her dreams into reality. Being awarded the Market the Music 'Emerging Artist Scholarship' in early 2017 led to an appearance on the CMC Awards red carpet wearing a one of a kind RACY & LUCKY gown and then a festival stage debut playing the at the Groundwater Country Music Festival. Abbie has now written with some of the finest songwriters in Australian country music recorded her debut single entitled 'For A Moment' that will be released in July 2018 through Social Family Records. Having recently completed her high school studies and cleared the path for her musical passions, there is little doubt that we will be hearing a lot more from Abbie Ferris in the future!
