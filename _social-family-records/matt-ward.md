Delivering a soulful blend Australian Country and Americana music, Matt Ward's musical journey has not been typical.

Working for years in land management across South Australia, Matt has an intimate knowledge of the country's interior and its people. Time on the road, connection to country, emotions experienced along the way - it is the lifeblood of country musicians, and Matt has it in spades.

Strong urban roots also ground his songwriting in compelling authenticity, and recently living and touring out of Texas has only served to expand Matt's influences and rich life experiences.

Produced by the award-winning Matt Fell at Sydney's Love Hz Studio, Annabelle is the first single release from Ward's upcoming album Heartland.

Seamlessly combining classic Australian influences with modern country finesse, it is easy to draw comparison to Paul Kelly, Whiskeytown (Ryan Adams) and Jason Isbell in Matt's songwriting, vocals and band arrangements.

"Matt Ward is THAT guy" Fell said of Ward. Wordsmith, tunesmith, craftsman. A songwriter's songwriter whose material speaks deeply and simultaneously of his own journey and of ours.

That is high praise and there is no doubt Matt is forging his own sound within the Australian country and Americana scenes.

Australian Music Network described Matt as a" musician of high promise "and since the successful release of his debut EP in 2016, Matt has showcased at Australian Music Week, performed at some of Tamworth's hottest events such as Late Nite Alt and Country Cocktails, and has often been selected to showcase for the Americana Association of Australia.

With soulful vocals, a compelling narrative and rich arrangements, Matt Ward and his debut album Heartland will prove to be one of the best country finds of recent years.

(Matt is also strengthening his reputation internationally, recently touring in America's south with acclaimed country outlaw Bonnie Montgomery. Matt's songs evoke the vastness and expanse of Australia while speaking with true heart. Bonnie said of Matt. He is a spokesman of our time and his music a perfect blend of Australian country outlaw)
