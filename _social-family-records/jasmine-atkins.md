# Jasmine Atkins

Jasmine Atkins is a vibrant new personality on the Australian Music landscape, quickly winning over audiences with her infectious personality and distinctive vocals, her sound drawing influences from the likes of Kasey Chambers, Keith Urban and Carrie Underwood.

Jasmine started performing at the age of 3, teaching herself to read music and was even writing songs by 8. Graduating from the Academy of Country Music in 2015, she was hungry for success. In February that year, Jasmine was awarded the WA Country Music Award for Songwriter of the Year. She also won the 2016 CCMA National Talent Quest and competed in the Trans-Tasman Entertainer of the Year Competition, taking home the Most Promising Artist title.

2017 kicked off with three WA Country Music Award nominations, and the June release of Jasmine’s debut video clip, Sun Will Come Out Again.&nbsp; The end of that year was spent co-writing with Kirsty Lee Akers, Matt Scullion, Troy Kemp, and Kristy James, which she’s brought to life in 2018, with her first single in sixteen months, ***Get Gone***, out now.&nbsp; This year also saw Jasmine nominated for 5 Awards at the WACMA’s (Female Artist, Single of the Year, Video of the Year, Emerging Artist and Songwriter of the Year), winning the Emerging Artist award.

Jasmine's second single, Where I've Never Been, is due for release in June 2019.
