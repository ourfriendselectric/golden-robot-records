In October of 2016, the young family trio signed an international record deal with independent label **Golden Robot Records/Social Family Records.**

Based in the Northern Rivers of New South Wales, Australia, the group consists of Sarah Grace Buckley (17yo–Lead Vocals, Acoustic Guitar), Molly Buckley (14yo–Vocals, Mandolin) and Lachlan Buckley (16yo–Electric Guitar, Slide Guitar). Growing up in musical family (Their Dad the former drummer of Legendary Australian Rock'n' Roll band The Radiators), from a young age they were exposed to a diverse array of musical genres including Country, Swing, Motown, Rockabilly, Rock'n'Roll, Bluegrass, Blues and Jazz. From Patsy Cline to The Rolling Stones, Kasey Chambers, Keith Urban, Nat King Cole, Ray Charles, The Eagles, Brian Setzer etc. music has always been intrinsically apart of their lives.

The group officially formed in 2011 when on a family holiday at the Tamworth Country Music festival. Jamming on Peel street, they were notified the following day that they had made the top 10 in the Tamworth Country Music Festival busking competition (Not knowing they were in any competition!), with over 600 acts competing. They were invited to perform on the main stage to some thousands of people the next day. From there, the band have gone on to perform with many of the greats including Jim Lauderdale, James T from American Blues Band Canned Heat, Bill Chambers, The Kentucky Headhunters, Rafe Van Hoy, Smokin, Joe Robinson, Carter and Carter and many others. Sarah, a graduate of the 2014 Academy of

Country Music in Tamworth, was awarded top 5 in the 2014 American Songwriting Awards (in association with Gwen Stefani) for her song Running Away released by The Buckleys, and the following year both Sarah and Molly were once again nominated for a prestigious ASA Award for Best of the Best. Amalgamating their love for, and upbringing in, Country Music with the influence of Rock n Roll, Blues, Motown, Swing, Jazz and even Funk, their unique sound and honest lyrics create an appeal that resonates with multiple genres and across numerous demographics.
