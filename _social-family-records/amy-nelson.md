# Amy Nelson

***Dontcha Dare Do It ***is the latest single and third release here from Canadian country artist, **Amy Nelson**, following ***ish*** and ***Hey Love*** from her unreleased album titled **Good Intentions**.

An up-tempo, catchy song, ***Dontcha Dare Do It*** pokes fun at the bad decisions people sometimes make (Amy included) even though they know they shouldn’t and will regret it later.&nbsp; It’s available for pre-order on digital platforms now and set for release on 14 January, in time for Nelson’s return to Australia – her eighth time travelling down under in the past 2 years\!

Heading back to perform at the Tamworth Country Music Festival, Amy has previously performed on the main stage at the Groundwater Country Music Festival, showcased at Australian Music Week and supported Kirsty Lee Akers on her “Nashville to the Top” tour.

Back home, Nelson manages a busy schedule performing at events such as the Calgary Stampede and Canadian Music Week and was this year named the 2018 SCMA Fans Choice Entertainer of the Year and released her third album in Canada. Despite all of this excitement in the Great White North, she always finds time to come back and perform in Australia.
