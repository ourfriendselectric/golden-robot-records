# Chelsea Berman

Chelsea Berman started performing at the tender age of 8, getting her start on the stage in musical theatre. From these humble beginnings on the Central Coast of New South Wales, her determination to become a professional recording artist, touring consistently throughout Australia, has seen her grow into an accomplished young performer.

Now in her teens, her warmth and approachability as a person, coupled with her strong sense of personal style, Berman has all the building blocks for a bright and successful career.

In early 2018, Better Than Ever, the debut release from this exciting new talent hit the airwaves. Released independently, the 5-track EP exceeded expectations, achieving the Apple iTunes Country Album \#4 Chart Position. Amazingly, Berman was both the highest placed Australian artist, and highest placed female artist on release.

Already a polished songwriter, Berman has created many exciting opportunities on this front, having already co-written with top talent including Chelsea Basham (Golden Guitar and CMC Award Winner), Rachael Fahim (Toyota Star Maker Winner), Dean Ray (X-Factor Finalist) and Melanie Dyer (The Voice). With firm plans to grow her skillset as a singer-songwriter, expect to see many more exciting writing collaborations before the next release.

The remainder of 2018 represented an exciting period for Berman, having already supported top ARIA charting talent in Kirsty Lee Akers and Kristy James. She was also added to her first three major festival circuit spots on Country At The Camp, Central Coast Country Music Festival and Great Northern Country Festival.

When it comes to emerging talent on the Australian music scene, Chelsea Berman is certainly turning heads and gaining traction. Heading into 2019, Berman was named as a 2019 Toyota Star Maker finalist and coupled with her personal drive and will to succeed, as well as her new single, there is little doubt that we will all be hearing a lot about this unique talent in future.
